*** NB: THIS LIBRARY IS NOT YET FUNCTIONAL. ***

libspace aims to define uniform interface to different methods for
discretizing function spaces over bounded or periodic subsets O of
R^n, in particular L^1(O), L^2(O) and H^1(O).

With libspace, the programmer should not care whether the
discretization is done with a regular finite difference grid, a
non-uniform grid, some finite element method or analytic basis
functions. The purpose of this is to allow rapid comparison of
performance characteristics and accuracy of the different approaches
to ones particular application, and easily plugging in new numerical
methods without changing application code.

A number of backends implement the actual discretizations.

CURRENT SUPPORT:

Discretization backends:

	+ grid/regulargrid	A simple implementation of uniform grid
	  			finite differences. Has no dependencies on
				external libraries.
	+ fem/deal.II/		FEM discretization using the deal.II finite 
	  			element Differential Equation Analysis Library.
				(http://www.dealii.org).
Storage:

	+ storage/simple	
	
SCHEDULED SUPPORT:

Discretization backends:

	+ fem/libmesh		FEM discretization using libmesh 
	  			(http://libmesh.sourceforge.net)
	+ fem/dolfin		FEM discretization using libdolfin from the
	  			FeNiCs project.
	+ grid/logaritmic
